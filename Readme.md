# CRUD Application with PHP, MySQL, AJAX, and MVC

This project demonstrates how to create a basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application using **PHP**, **MySQL**, **AJAX**, and the **MVC** design pattern. The application is designed to manage a set of records in a database (e.g., a list of users, products, or tasks).

## Features

- **Create**: Add new records to the database.
- **Read**: Display records in a table with pagination and search functionality.
- **Update**: Edit and update existing records.
- **Delete**: Delete records from the database.
- **AJAX**: Handle asynchronous requests to update the UI without reloading the page.
- **MVC Architecture**: Organized code following the Model-View-Controller design pattern.

## Prerequisites

Before running this application, make sure you have the following installed:

- **PHP** (7.4 or higher)
- **MySQL** (5.6 or higher)
- **Apache Server** or **XAMPP** / **WAMP** (if you're using a local server environment)
- **AJAX** (for making asynchronous requests)
- **Text Editor or IDE** for coding (e.g., VS Code, Sublime Text, PHPStorm)

## Installation
